## Appendix 1
 The main premise of this dissertation is the idea that the digital surrogate is more than just an image of the original object. Presenting the digital surrogates referred to within the texts only as a printed image, rather than as a digital object in its designed environment, would at best unnecessarily limit them and at worst misrepresent them. Therefore, in discussion with my supervisors, I have decided to create this online repository containing all referenced works.

* homepage with responsive grid and figures, most a direct link to the native environment, some linking to other pages
* the few categories that are native to this page will be in a non-responsive grid with small info
* about page explaining the appendix and the research, linked from the title on the homepage
